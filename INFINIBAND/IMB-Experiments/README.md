### Concept of Latency & Bandwidth & Throughput

- **Measuring Network Latency**
    - Network tools like ping tests and trace route measure latency by determining the time it takes a given network packet to travel from source to destination and back, the so-called round-trip time. Round-trip time is not the only way to measure latency, but it is the most common.


- **A simple example**
    - An assembly line is manufacturing cars. It takes eight hours to manufacture a car and that the factory produces one hundred and twenty cars per day.
    - The latency is: 8 hours.
    - The throughput is: 120 cars / day or 5 cars / hour.


- **Definitions of Latency and throughput**
    - Latency means time when a particular packet takes to reach the destination from source
    - Throughput is the amount of data that can traverse through a given medium. The network throughput is measured in bits per second (bps).



- **Difference between throughput and bandwidth**
    - Bandwidth are the theoretical maximum units of work per unit of time
    - Throughput are the actual units of work per unit of time

Consider
A highway which has a capacity of moving ,say, 200 vehicles at a time

but
at a random time someone notices only , say, 150 vehicles moving through it..

say due to some jam in between...
i.e.

capacity is 200 but not all the time it is fully utilised, actual traffic is only 150 out of a max of 200.
i.e. the bandwidth is 200 per unit time but still actual throughput is 150 ...
