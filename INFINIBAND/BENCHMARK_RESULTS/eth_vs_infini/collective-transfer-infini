# Reduce
# each process ends a number to the root then the total number is calculated by the root

# Allreduce
# same as reduce but the final result is sent to all processes

# Scatter
# the root of the process sends a message to all processes. The size of the message equals to chosen size * number of processes

# Reduce_Scatter
# same as reduce but followed by scatter

# Gather
# all processes send the same message to the root

# Alltoall
# all processes send a message of a size equal to the chosen size number of processes to all processes

# Bcast
# the root process broadcasts data to all processes
